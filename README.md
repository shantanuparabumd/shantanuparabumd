# üí´ About Me:

I am deeply engaged in several impactful projects that align with advancing robotics and machine learning:

- **Path Planning Contributions to Open Source**: Contributing to the open-source repository [AutonomousVehicleControlBeginnersGuide](https://github.com/ShisatoYano/AutonomousVehicleControlBeginnersGuide), where I am implementing path planning algorithms like A* to make foundational concepts in self-driving car technology more accessible to students and enthusiasts.

- **Reinforcement Learning with MuJoCo**: Developing reinforcement learning frameworks using MuJoCo for robotic control. This includes creating robust environments and algorithms to refine robotic motion through advanced reinforcement learning techniques.

- **Imitation Learning for Aloha Kits**: Leveraging Action Chunking Transformers to train Aloha Kits for imitation learning tasks. My work focuses on designing policies, generating sample trajectories, and optimizing models to teach robots complex tasks effectively.

- **Sim-to-Real Transfer for Aloha Kits**: Building an end-to-end framework to seamlessly transition policies trained in simulation to physical robots, ensuring real-world applicability and performance consistency.

- **Integration of Aloha Kits with LeRobot**: Collaborating with Hugging Face to integrate Aloha Kits into the LeRobot framework. This includes enabling multi-camera support and creating streamlined workflows for dataset collection and training.
